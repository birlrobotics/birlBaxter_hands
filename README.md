    In this folder we will contain programs that manipulate the grippers of the Baxter robot.

# Overview

    Code will be organized by type of gripper. So far we have the following types:
    
    1. Rethink Standard Fingers:   two-finger electric grippers that come with Baxter.
    2. Pivot Approach Camera Mold: Specialized end-effector tool that holds camera molds. Derived from the openhand project. Still uses the standard actuators.
    3. Openhand Project:
    4. Yale Open Hand Project: 

# Motivation

    Providing some solution adapting on gripper of baxter rethink robot,including mounting Force torque sensor on baxter hands with saker gripper and electric gripper,camera holer design and camera gripper
